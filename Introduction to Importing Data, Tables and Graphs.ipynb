    "- To import data from a .csv/.txt file, we write `Table.read_table(\"file_name\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create our own table, we write `Table( ).with_columns(\"Column Name\", array_name, . . .)` . \n",
    "\n",
    "- To count number of rows, we use `table_name.num_rows`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To count number of columns, we use `table_name.num_columns`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table with only the columns indicated in the parameters, we use `table_name.select(\"COLUMN NAME\", ...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table without the columns indicated in the parameters, we use `table_name.drop(\"COLUMN NAME\", ...)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a table with only certain values, we can use `table_name.where(column_name, predicate)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To create a new table with indicated rows from the original table, we use `table_name.take([index 1, index 2, . . . ])`. Remember in Python indices start at 0!\n",
    "\n",
    "- To execute a scatter plot, we use `table.scatter(column for x axis, column for y axis)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To execute a line plot, we use `table.plot(x column, y column)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a bar graphs, we can use either `table.bar(x column, y column)` or `table.barh(x column, y column)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To make a histogram, we use `table.hist(x axis, bins(optional), unit(optional))`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- To merge tables, we use either `append` or `append_column`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- To merge two tables with a common column name we use the `join` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just some simple code, we were able to do an incredible amount of data analysis! Play around with the examples until you feel comfortable with the content of this notebook. We will be using notebooks to analyze your own data sets in the future! Please ask if you have questions!\n",
